# Supported Unreal Engine game AES keys.
Most of the games FModel supports don't have AES keys, but if they do, they typically don't change.
This repository is made to consolidate what the AES key(s) are for games that have rarely or unchanging AES keys.
More games / AES keys may be added in the future.

## List of games that require AES keys that we officially support in CUE4Parse and FModel
- Fortnite
- Valorant
- Borderlands 3
- Spellbreak
- Minecraft Dungeons
